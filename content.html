                spacious rooms and such an extensive breakfast buffet
                makes it an attractive option for both couples and families. A spa treatment at Eforea spa in the hotel
                is included in your Hilton Honors Experience, so make

                <h3> Meals, drinks, and nibbles</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Isn’t food the highlight of every holiday? This Hilton Honors Experience includes several meals that you
                will love to bits. Grab some cocktails at Fix Bar –
                they have several interesting ones on offer including a Watermelon Negroni that we loved! Don’t leave
                without sampling the nibbles, especially the halloumi fries
                with garlic aioli. You will definitely be asking for seconds.<br><br>Another meal that is included in
                this experience, and one you shouldn’t skip, is a relaxed dinner
                at Catch Restaurant. Here fresh ingredients, sustainable seafood, and occasionally Asian flavours come
                together to create a delectable meal, one you will remember
                for a while. Come hungry and try the signature Seafood Platter for two.

                <h4> Entry to Gold Coast’s iconic theme parks </h4>
            </li>
            <p>
                You can’t visit the Gold Coast without visiting its iconic theme parks. They offer the perfect excuse to
                have some much-needed fun with friends, family, or your partner.
                Tickets to Dreamworld and WhiteWater World are included in this experience, so we would suggest keeping
                one entire day for this. Make sure you’re amongst the first to
                enter Dream World (gates open at 10 am). Scream your lungs out on the crazy roller coasters (The Claw is
                a specially fun one!),feast on snacks, witness a parade or two,
                and enjoy the excitement in the air. Dreamworld makes for a fun day out. If you’re a water baby at
                heart, then head over to the adjoining Whitewater World for the rest of the day.
                <br><br><i>Make sure you wear comfortable clothes and shoes. And don’t forget to carry your swimwear and
                    sunscreen for the adventure.</i>

                <h5>A visit to Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary </h5>
            </li>
            <p>
                You can’t come to Australia and leave without seeing kangaroos right? Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary is
                the perfect place to witness kangaroos and koalas in their habitats.
                The sprawling sanctuary is a magnet for kids, so we would definitely recommend it if you are travelling
                with your family. Kids can feed baby kangaroos, watch koalas, and
                even get photos with them.
            </p>

                <h6>Take a surfing lesson or chill at a secluded beach </h6>
            </li>
            <p>
                It isn’t called the Gold Coast for nothing! The area is home to dozens of powdery beaches. You could
                enrol yourself for a surfing lesson at Surfers Paradise
                that is included in your Hilton Honors Experience. And if surfing isn’t your cup of tea, and you just
                want to relax at the beach or read a book by the water,
                then we’d suggest heading to one of the many secluded beaches in the area. Tallebudgera Creek, Snapper
                Rocks, and Greenmount Beach are just a couple of options.
